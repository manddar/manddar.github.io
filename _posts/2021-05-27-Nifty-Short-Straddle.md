I initiated Nifty short straddle today for deep OTM strikes with same premium on Call & Put both sides and June month expiry. Added couuple of current expiry deep OTM long positions as hedge to protect account from sudden movement in Market.

*SHORT*

- NIFTY JUN 14100 PE = 27.20
- NIFTY JUN 16200 CE = 27.95

*LONG* 

- NIFTY 10th w JUN 13500 PE = 5.10
- NIFTY 10th w JUN 16300 CE = 5.75

I am going to exit positions on 10th June and start with new positions for next month expiry at that time. Expected profit is 2800 considering brokerage and hedge positions.

- Expected profit = 2800
- Margin required = 84000
- ROI in two weeks = 3.3%

Margin blocked for this position is 84000 hence the ROI for two weeks is 3.3%. I will put followup updates every 3/4 days.
