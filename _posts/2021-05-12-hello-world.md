## Hello world 

This is my first post on this blog. I own this domain since long and was not sure what to do with it. I use this as placeholder for various tools that I use for Finance Management and to listen to some webhooks used by my python scripts.

Its been so long, I have written something about anything but now I plan to write about personal experiences I come across in routine life.

This pandemic has put us in home and left us think about new hobies and work that we can do by not going outside home. This made me start investing in stocks, use new technologies to ease some work, search and cook different food & regular excercise and meditation. I was never able to start excercising due to time I was spending in travelling but since now I am working from home its no more a hrudle. 

Though I plan to post as much as I can, but no fixed frequency in mind as I want to keep it side task for me. 

Lets see how it goes. Do tell me about what you are doing differently during pandemic on [@manddar](https://twitter.com/manddar).
