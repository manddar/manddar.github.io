So this happened to one of my relative recently.

One of my cousine passed away due to covid at his early 40s leaving behind wife and 2 daughters. They were struggling to get everything sorted about his financial belongings. One of the thing was credit card.

He had 4 credit cards and we wanted to cancel / close all of them. While American express and other private bank card was easy to close we struggled a lot with SBI credit card. Initially we blocked SBI credit card thinking that we will cut it and throw the card. But they sent 3 new cards. Then we started calling call center but failed for 3 days to get through the call. We found [IVR flow PDF](https://www.sbicard.com/sbi-card-en/assets/docs/pdf/contact-us/personal/ivr.pdf) on SBI Cards site which showed us the exact number sequence which can get in touch with person who can assist us. After multiple tries we could get hold of CSA and he told us about email id where we need to write mail and attach death certificate copy.

I though there might be many people struggling with same problem hence mentioning email (customercare@sbicard.com) here.
